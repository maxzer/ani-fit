# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on enhancing the project's asset management by implementing local image support. We have transitioned from using external image URLs to locally stored images for better reliability and performance.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank documentation
- Explored the project structure
- Identified key technologies and frameworks in use
- Documented the system architecture and patterns
- **Implemented local image support**:
  - Created directory structure for storing images
  - Added utility composables for working with local images
  - Updated components to use local image paths
  - Added fallback mechanisms for image loading

## Active Decisions
- Establishing documentation structure through Memory Bank
- Identifying key project components and relationships
- Planning development approach for upcoming features
- **Image management strategy**:
  - Organizing images by categories (services, icons, backgrounds, etc.)
  - Implementing utilities for responsive image handling
  - Providing fallback mechanisms for missing images

## Next Steps
1. Explore the frontend and backend code in more detail
2. Identify immediate development priorities
3. Establish development workflows and coding standards
4. Review existing features and functionality
5. Plan for upcoming feature implementation
6. **Further enhance image management**:
   - Implement image optimization pipeline
   - Add support for responsive images
   - Develop image preloading strategy

## Open Questions
- Specific fitness features to be implemented
- Data model structure for fitness tracking
- Integration points with external services or APIs
- User authentication flow and requirements
- Performance optimization strategies
- **Image management considerations**:
  - Best practices for image caching
  - Strategies for handling user-uploaded images
  - Image compression and optimization workflows

## Current Challenges
- Gaining complete understanding of the existing codebase
- Determining the current state of development
- Identifying potential technical debt
- Establishing best practices for project continuation
- **Managing image assets efficiently**:
  - Balancing image quality and performance
  - Ensuring cross-browser compatibility
  - Implementing proper fallback mechanisms
