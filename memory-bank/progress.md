# Progress

## Project Status
The project is in its initial documentation phase. We have established the Memory Bank structure to track progress and maintain comprehensive documentation of the Ani-Fit application.

## What Works
- Project structure with frontend (Nuxt.js) and backend (Fastify) components
- Basic development setup with npm scripts for development and production
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Memory Bank documentation structure
- **Local images support**: Added functionality for loading images locally from the project

## In Progress
- Detailed exploration of existing codebase
- Documenting current features and functionality
- Understanding the fitness tracking requirements and implementation

## What's Left to Build
- Complete feature set for fitness tracking
- User authentication and profile management
- Workout scheduling and calendar integration
- Progress visualization and statistics
- Mobile-responsive UI implementation
- API endpoints for fitness data management

## Known Issues
- No specific issues identified yet; full codebase exploration is pending

## Recent Achievements
- Initialized Memory Bank documentation
- Documented project architecture and technical stack
- Established foundation for ongoing development
- **Implemented local images support**:
  - Created structure for storing images locally
  - Developed utilities for working with local images
  - Integrated local images in UI components
